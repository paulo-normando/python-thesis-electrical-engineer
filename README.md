Defense thesis for the degree in electrical engineering

This work presents a reliability calculation tool for a device at a given time in the future, to be defined by the user using the Google Collaboratory Research platform, with Python as the programming  language in its third version. The database used comes from a real-time data collection system at the kaolin processing plant of the mining company Imerys Performance Minerals Americas Hub Capim, where equipment, cause, total downtime and other relevant parameters are recorded for the company. The result of the developed code was satisfactory, bringing to the company a new type of monitoring of the improvements that were implemented in project forms. The perspective is that this tool will help guide maintenance engineering decisions in real time, bringing the business closer to an optimal relationship between profit, equipment availability and maintenance cost.

Keywords: Data Science, Reliability, Maintenance Engineering, Google Collaboratory Research, Python, Mining, Kaolin.
